      <h2 id="Respiratory_system">Human respiratory system</h2>
      <p>
        The respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, windpipe, and lungs. Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or the mouth.
        If it goes in the nostrils (also called nares), the air is warmed and humidified. Tiny hairs called cilia (pronounced: SIL-ee-uh) protect the nasal passageways and other parts of the respiratory tract, filtering out dust and other particles that enter the nose through the breathed air.

        The two openings of the airway (the nasal cavity and the mouth) meet at the pharynx (pronounced: FAR-inks), or throat, at the back of the nose and mouth. The pharynx is part of the digestive system as well as the respiratory system because it carries both food and air. <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/lungs.html#:~:text=What%20Are%20the%20Parts%20of,air%20is%20warmed%20and%20humidified." target="_blank"> (Learn More)</a>

      <h2 id="Circulatory_system">Human circulatory system</h2>
      <p>
        The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide.<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system" target="_blank">(Learn More)</a>

      <p>
        How does my digestive system work?
        Each part of your digestive system helps to move food and liquid through your GI tract, break food and liquid into smaller parts, or both. Once foods are broken into small enough parts, your body can absorb and move the nutrients to where they are needed. Your large intestine absorbs water, and the waste products of digestion become stool. Nerves and hormones help control the digestive process.<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system" target="_blank">(Learn More)</a>

    <h2 id="locomotor_system">Human locomotor system</h2>
    <p>The locomotor system is also known as the musculoskeletal system. It is made up of the skeleton, the skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage and other connective tissue. These parts work together to allow movement.</p>
    <h3>Let's read about it!</h3>
    <p>The brain controls the movements of the body, using information from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the eyes</li>
      <li>the ears, including special canals which give us a three-dimensional sense of motion</li>
      <li>the muscles themselves, called 'muscle sense' or kinaesthesia.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The skeleton</h3>
    <p>
      The skeleton is made up of 206 bones. Bones are a form of connective tissue reinforced with calcium and bone cells. Bones have a softer centre, called marrow, where blood cells are made. The three main functions of the skeleton are:
      support-he body is supported and shaped by the skeleton; for example upright posture would be impossible without a spine
      protection-our internal organs are protected by our skeleton, such as the brain inside the skull, the heart and lungs inside the ribcage
      movement-most skeletal muscles are attached to bones in opposite working groups, like the biceps and triceps muscles of the upper arm.
      The skeleton also stores minerals (such as calcium) and lipids (fats), and produces blood cells in the bone marrow.
    </p>
    <h3>Skeletal muscles</h3>
    <p>
      Skeletal muscles operate under voluntary control;this means that we ask them to move, and they do. Involuntary muscles (smooth muscle) work whether we consciously ask them to or not; for example, the muscles that line the digestive system.
      Skeletal muscles are made up of muscle fibres, bundled together. Each fibre can contract or relax on demand. All fibres contract together to shorten a muscle. The command to contract or relax is given by the brain and relayed to the muscle by nerves.<a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/locomotor-system" target="_blank">(Learn More)</a>

    <h2 id="immune_system">Human immune system</h2>
    <p>Your immune system is your body's first-line defense against invaders like germs. It helps protect you from getting sick and promotes healing when you're unwell or injured. You can strengthen your immune system by eating nutritious foods, exercising and getting enough sleep.<a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/locomotor-system" target="_blank">(Learn More)</a></p>
    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Many parts of your body, including immune system organs and cells, work together to keep you healthy. The main components of your immune system are:</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>White blood cells: These immune system cells attack and eliminate harmful germs to keep you healthy. There are many types of white blood cells, and each type has a specific mission in your body's defense system. Each type also has a different way of recognizing a problem, communicating with other cells and getting their job done.</li>
          <li>
            Antibodies: These proteins protect you from invaders by binding to them and initiating their destruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skin: Your skin is a protective barrier that helps stop germs from entering your body. It produces oils and releases other protective immune system cells.
          </li>
        </ul>
